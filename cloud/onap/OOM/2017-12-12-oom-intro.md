# OOM


## 1.Introduction
ONAP Operations Manager (OOM) is an ONAP tool to efficiently deploy, manage and operate the ONAP platform and its components (e.g. MSO, DCAE, SDC, etc.).

The OOM project takes a cloud-native approach to manage the OOM cluster and relies on Kubernetes as the main platform to manage ONAP services.

In this post, we will focus on a sub-project within the OOM (OOM with TOSCA and Cloudify) that utilizes TOSCA to manage the K8s cluster as well as the ONAP services running on top of the K8s cluster.
