## onap release flow ##

maven release plugin is used for this, which would:

•	Checkout SNAPSHOT version poms, e.g. “1.1-SNAPSHOT”
•	Update poms to release version, e.g. “1.1”
•	Build and run all tests
•	Commit release version poms into git repo
•	Tag this “release version” commit in git
•	Update poms to next SNAPSHOT version, e.g. “1.2-SNAPSHOT”
•	Commit new SNAPSHOT version poms into git repo

However, this conflicts with our use of staging/RC builds since we obviously don’t want to commit pom changes for every RC build.  

To work with staging/RC builds, the ODL method of saving git bundles for later tagging seems like it would work fine.  Are there any downsides to this approach?
